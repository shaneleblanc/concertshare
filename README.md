# ConcertShare
Welcome! ConcertShare is a free tool to find concerts with your friends. You can create custom groups that allow you and your friends to share a concert feed. For both personal and group feeds, you may customize the feed by selecting your followed artists (Import artists from Spotify and Last.fm coming soon!), the cities you're willing to travel to for shows, and how far in the future you'd like to see concerts.
